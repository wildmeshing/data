# Seamed Meshes
This directory contains a series of objs with seams which are mostly paired with files in the [EE](./EE) folder that annotate the pairs of edges that form each seam.

These pairs are easily accessible with the [files.js](./files.js) file, which details the relative paths of the pairs. This file can be re-generated by invoking the [make_pairs.bash](./make_pairs.bash) script.
